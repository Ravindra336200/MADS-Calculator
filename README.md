# MADS-Calculator
Contrary to typical BODMAS rule followed in solving mathematical operations everywhere, we are introducing a new rule (solely for this test). In case of MADS rule, we assume the mathematical operator ‘(‘ or ‘)’ is not used, and instead we only use operators ‘+, -, *, /’. Where the precedence of the operators are in the order of MADS - M (*) > A(+) > D(/) > S(-).
